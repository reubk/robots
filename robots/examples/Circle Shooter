;  Robot Name:  Circle Shooter;;  This robot simply moves around in a circle and tries to shoot anything;  in it's path.  It scans in a circle very quickly using large radar increments;  to catch robots that are close by quickly.  An improvement would be to lock;  on to a robot if it is close enough.  This would be especially nice if since;  the fire rate of this robot is high and we have no cloaking ability.CPU_SPEED 0ARMOR 2FIRE_RATE 3     ;Be able to shoot oftenENGINE_SIZE 0   ;If in the middle of the battlefield then should be able to see most anywhere   ;with a radar range of 0.RADAR_RANGE 0CLOAKING 0FUEL_CAPACITY 1define startangle 25allocate maxSpeed    20 to maxSpeed    gosub goto_middle               ;Move towards the middle before running circles    int_routine to time_int_xfer    ;Setup time interrupt routine    1 to time_int_maskagain    gosub look_and_shootgoto again;Look for a robot and shoot it if one foundlook_and_shoot    aim + 37 to aim  ;look around quickly to catch close robots.    aim to radar    if radar > 0 then         if shot = 0 then  ;If can't shoot yet, then try to stay on enemy            radar to shot        else            aim - 37 to aim        end    end    if speed = 0 then        direction + 90 to direction  ;Try to move out of harms way        maxSpeed to speed    endreturngoto_middle   ;Move to the center of the arena    if x > 190 then        270 to direction        while x > 185 do   ;In right half of arena, move left.            maxSpeed to speed            gosub look_and_shoot        end    else        90 to direction        while x < 195 do    ;In left half of arena, move right.            maxSpeed to speed            gosub look_and_shoot        end    end    if y < 146 then         ;Start a little up from center to start at the top of our circle        180 to direction        while y < 141 do    ;In top half of arena, move down.            maxSpeed to speed            gosub look_and_shoot        end    else        0 to direction        while y > 151 do    ;In bottom half of arena, move up            maxSpeed to speed            gosub look_and_shoot        end    end    90 to direction  ;Always start to the rightreturnint_routine    direction + 6 to direction  ;Every 1/10th of a second, turn right 6 degreesendint
